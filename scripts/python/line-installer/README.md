# Line Installer for openSUSE Leap 15.0
This is specifically for openSUSE Leap, however if you  modify a line or two it can be ported to other Linuxes. 

## Introduction
Basically a fully integrated script to 
build line (windows app) on openSUSE Leap 15.0.
Use and abuse as you please.

The plan is to extend this quite a lot when
time allows. 

## Background
Here in Japan Line is almost a way of life. Everyone uses it to communicate with each other and without it you will quickly find yourself losing touch with friends or family. It is also a useful tool for expats in Japan to keep in touch with family back home.
