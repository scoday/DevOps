# Basic Ansible Building Block
This is just a very, very basic foundation file. The ansible inventory or 'hosts' file should live in
/etc/ansible/hosts (or wherever you keep it). This is a playbook that just manages some base attributes
and was more of a testing environment.

## This is for OpenSUSE Leap
The playbook here is for suse as it uses ZYPPER. Replace that with apt / yum / dnf / etc..
